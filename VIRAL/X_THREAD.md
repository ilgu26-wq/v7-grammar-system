AI doesn't fail because it predicts wrong.
It fails because it acts when it shouldn't.

We do not predict prices.
We observe freedom.

We built a system that classifies
WHEN action is forbidden.

Not a strategy.
Not alpha.
A safety layer.

The core distinction is not signal vs noise,
but actionable vs non-actionable worlds.

This boundary is learned from data,
not imposed by heuristics.

Irreversibility is not volatility.

It is a collapse of freedom:
once it happens, prior alternatives no longer exist.

Resonance occurs inside storms, not before them.

Direction does not exist as a stable target—
only as a conditional side-effect near rupture.

Direction policy:
Used for exit / hedging only.
Never for entry.

We do not claim direction prediction.

This is not alpha, but it is important.

As AI systems grow stronger,
knowing when NOT to act
becomes a first-class safety problem.
