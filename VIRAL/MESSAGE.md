# Viral Core Message (LOCKED)

## Slogan (Fixed)

We do not predict prices.  
We observe freedom.

---

## Core Claim

- Prediction ❌  
- Alpha ❌  

This system separates **actionable vs non-actionable states** from data.

As AI systems grow stronger,  
an explicit **action prohibition layer** becomes mandatory.

---

## Conclusion

Trading is allowed only in living worlds.

---

## Direction Policy (Safety Constraint)

Direction is a side-effect,  
observable only inside healthy worlds  
and only near rupture.

Used for **exit / hedging only**.  
Never for entry.

---

## Positioning Guardrails

- This is NOT a strategy.
- This is NOT an alpha generator.
- This is NOT a prediction model.

This is a **safety layer**  
for autonomous decision systems.
