# Validation Cases (A–F)

This document indexes the completed validation cases
used to verify the structural integrity of the V7 Grammar System.

These validations test **decision admissibility, execution ordering,
and failure containment** — not portfolio performance.

---

## Covered Validation Dimensions

- Case A: Asset invariance (NQ / ES)
- Case B: Roll and continuous contract behavior
- Case C: Multi-timeframe consistency
- Case D: Event stress (COVID / CPI / banking events)
- Case E: Portfolio independence constraints
- Case F: Execution integrity and ordering

---

## Notes

- All cases were executed without parameter tuning
- No optimization feedback was allowed
- Results are reported at the decision-grammar level

Detailed artifacts and raw outputs are stored
in the research and validation directories.
