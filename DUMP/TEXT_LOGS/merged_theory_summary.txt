===== V7 FORCE INSTRUMENT: DEPTH-BASED WORLD PARTITION =====
===== FROZEN: 2026-02-01 =====

======================================================================
PART 1: CORE DISCOVERY - WORLD PARTITION
======================================================================

The trading world divides into two fundamentally different territories:

1. SLOW TERMINAL (88.9% of events)
   - Terminal_Time_R >= 0.3
   - E_RESP precedence: 96.8%
   - EXIT policy: FULLY APPLICABLE
   - Nature: Predictable, depth has time to form

2. FAST TERMINAL (11.1% of events)
   - Terminal_Time_R < 0.3
   - E_RESP precedence: 63.2% baseline
   - EXIT policy: CONDITIONAL ONLY
   - Nature: Unpredictable by single sensor

======================================================================
PART 2: THE 8-AXIS COMBINATION DISCOVERY
======================================================================

Single-variable judgment is INSUFFICIENT.
8-axis combination judgment is NECESSARY.

The 8 axes:
1. Terminal_Time_R (Fast/Slow) - PRIMARY PARTITION
2. Depth_bin (High/Low)
3. DC_pre_bin (Compressed/Loose)
4. Delta_bin (Small/Large)
5. Force_bin (Weak/Strong)
6. ER_bin (High/Low)
7. Theta_bin (High/Low)
8. Channel_bin (Top/Mid/Bot)

PROOF A CONFIRMED:
Even within FAST territory, 4 "islands" exist where judgment is possible:
- High_Comp_Large_Weak_Low_Low_Mid: 81.8%
- Low_Loose_Small_Weak_Low_Low_Mid: 75.0%
- High_Loose_Large_Weak_Low_Low_Mid: 72.7%
- Low_Loose_Large_Weak_Low_Low_Mid: 72.2%

This proves: "Combination judgment creates the real world, not single variables."

======================================================================
PART 3: OOS VALIDATION RESULTS
======================================================================

5-FOLD CROSS-VALIDATION:

FAST Islands:
| Island                              | Folds | Avg%  | Stable |
|-------------------------------------|-------|-------|--------|
| High_Comp_Large_Weak_Low_Low_Mid    | 4/5   | 85.4% | YES    |
| High_Loose_Large_Weak_Low_Low_Mid   | 5/5   | 74.3% | YES    |
| Low_Loose_Small_Weak_Low_Low_Mid    | 5/5   | 66.7% | YES    |
| Low_Loose_Large_Weak_Low_Low_Mid    | 5/5   | 61.3% | NO     |

3 out of 4 islands are OOS-stable.

SLOW Key Factors (97%+ precedence):
- delta = Small: 97.4% (N=693)
- depth = Low: 97.3% (N=1320)
- ER = Low: 97.1% (N=1713)
- channel = Top: 97.1% (N=555)

======================================================================
PART 4: HYPOTHESIS TEST RESULTS (H1-H5)
======================================================================

EXP-CONSOLIDATED-01 v1.1 Results:

H1' (Terminal Precedence - Split):
  - Soft/Absorb: 71.4% precedence
  - Hard: 28.6% (as expected, not predictable)
  - VERDICT: CONDITIONAL PASS

H2 (Terminal Spectrum):
  - SOFT MAE/ATR: 1.46
  - ABSORB MAE/ATR: 2.43
  - HARD MAE/ATR: 6.07
  - Monotonic: TRUE
  - VERDICT: PASS

H3' (Hard = HTF Switch Trigger):
  - Soft/Absorb reverse rate: within limits
  - Hard HTF switch rate: 53.5%
  - VERDICT: PASS

H4 (Regime Amplification):
  - BULL skew: -2pp
  - BEAR skew: +16pp
  - FLAT skew: +42pp
  - VERDICT: PASS

H5 (EXIT Scenario Effect):
  - MAE reduction: -31%
  - VERDICT: PASS

FINAL: 4/5 PASS = ENGINEERING-GRADE

======================================================================
PART 5: KEY FORMULAS
======================================================================

배율 (Ratio):
ratio = (close - low) / (high - close)
  → 1.5+ = overbought
  → 0.7- = oversold

채널% (Channel):
channel_pct = (close - low_20) / (high_20 - low_20) * 100
  → 90%+ = top zone
  → 20%- = bottom zone

Range Normalization:
MAE_R = MAE / session_range
Terminal_Time_R = terminal_bar / horizon

E_RESP State:
HOLD = directional pressure maintained
RELEASE = pressure dissipating

======================================================================
PART 6: WHAT IS NOT EXPLAINED (CRITICAL)
======================================================================

This partition explains STRUCTURE but not CAUSE.

NOT explained:
1. Why does Depth form in some cases and not others?
2. What micro-conditions lead to FAST terminal?
3. Can FAST risk be predicted BEFORE entry?

These are the targets of the NEXT research phase.

======================================================================
PART 7: NEXT PHASE DECLARATION
======================================================================

PREVIOUS PHASE (CLOSED):
"What does Depth explain?"

NEXT PHASE (OPEN):
"Under what conditions does Depth form instead of dissipate?"

This is a CAUSAL/DYNAMICAL problem, not a CLASSIFICATION problem.

Hypotheses for next phase:
- H-CAUSAL-1: Depth requires absorption phase before terminal
- H-CAUSAL-2: FAST terminal = external force injection
- H-CAUSAL-3: Depth formation is regime-dependent

======================================================================
