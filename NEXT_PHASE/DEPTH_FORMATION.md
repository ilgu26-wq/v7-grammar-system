# Next Research Objective: Depth Formation Dynamics

## Status of Previous Phase

All structural explanations based on Depth are considered **closed**.

The world partition (Fast/Slow Terminal based on 8-axis combination) is:
- Empirically validated across 2,783 events
- OOS-stable for 3 FAST islands
- 96.8% deterministic for SLOW terminal

**This phase is frozen. No further structural work is planned.**

---

## The Remaining Open Question

The remaining open question is **causal**:

1. What micro-level conditions allow Depth to **accumulate**?
2. What conditions cause **immediate dissipation** instead?
3. Why do certain regimes **never ignite** (remain in FAST)?

---

## Key Insight from Previous Phase

From EXP-ALL-LAWS-JOINT-01:

```
SLOW Terminal = 88.9% of events
  → High precedence, predictable
  → Depth has time to form

FAST Terminal = 11.1% of events
  → Low precedence baseline
  → Depth never accumulated
```

**Depth is treated as a RESULT, not a CAUSE.**

The question becomes: what creates the conditions for Depth to exist?

## Hypotheses for Next Phase

### H-CAUSAL-1: Depth Formation Requires Absorption Phase

> Depth accumulates only when price enters an "absorption zone" 
> (low volatility + low efficiency ratio) before terminal.

### H-CAUSAL-2: FAST Terminal = External Force Injection

> FAST terminals occur when external force (news, gap, macro event)
> overwhelms the micro-absorption process.

### H-CAUSAL-3: Depth is Regime-Dependent

> Depth formation is easier in RANGE regimes
> and harder in trending (BULL/BEAR) regimes.

---

## Methodology for Next Phase

1. **Identify pre-terminal micro-structure** (5-10 bars before terminal)
2. **Compare FAST vs SLOW pre-conditions**
3. **Build causal model** (not predictive, explanatory)

---

## Constraints

**No assumptions from the previous phase are extended automatically.**

- The 8-axis combination was for classification, not causation
- Depth's structural role is settled; its genesis is not
- All new hypotheses must be tested independently

---

## Success Criteria

The causal phase succeeds if:

1. We can explain **why** a terminal became FAST vs SLOW
2. The explanation is **not tautological** (not "FAST because it was fast")
3. The explanation has **predictive potential** (can identify FAST risk in advance)
