# Validation Summary

This directory contains structural integrity tests verifying that:

- V7 decisions are never altered by OPA
- No execution occurs at invalid theta states
- All executions occur within the defined scope
- Removed signals have no silent impact
- Results are fully reproducible

All tests are designed to validate system honesty, not performance.
