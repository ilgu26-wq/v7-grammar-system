# 04. FALSIFICATION

## Stress Tests and Break Attempts

---

## Purpose

This section documents deliberate attempts to break the theory.
All attempts failed.

---

## EXP-7: Broken Coordinates Test

**What we broke:** Coordinate definitions (τ → coarse, DC → squared)

**What we expected:** If Q depends on coordinate choice, structure collapses

**What survived:** Forbidden orbits preserved (Q4=0% at τ≤2)

**Judgment:** COORDINATE INDEPENDENT

---

## EXP-8: Adversarial Mixing Test

**What we broke:** Asset labels (mixed ES, NQ, BTC, CL, GC blindly)

**What we expected:** If Q is asset-specific, structure collapses

**What survived:**
- Q distribution preserved
- Forbidden orbits preserved (Q4=0% at τ≤2)
- Outcome ordering preserved (Q1 < Q4)

**Judgment:** ASSET-INDEPENDENT LAW

---

## EXP-9: Time Reversal Test

**What we broke:** Temporal direction (reversed trade sequence)

**What we expected:** If irreversibility is real, structure collapses

**What survived:** Nothing. Structure collapsed.

| Direction | Separation |
|-----------|------------|
| Forward | +3.48 |
| Reversed | -0.73 |

**Judgment:** IRREVERSIBILITY CONFIRMED

---

## EXP-10: Q-Ablation Test

**What we broke:** Q itself (removed, measured Micro alone)

**What we expected:** If Q is necessary, separation collapses

**What survived:** Only 7% of separation remained

| Condition | Separation |
|-----------|------------|
| With Q | 3.55 |
| Without Q | 0.24 |

**Judgment:** Q IS NECESSARY

## Summary Table

| EXP | Test | Result | Meaning |
|-----|------|--------|---------|
| 7 | Broken Coordinates | ✅ PASS | Q is coordinate-independent |
| 8 | Adversarial Mixing | ✅ PASS | Q is asset-independent |
| 9 | Time Reversal | ✅ PASS | Irreversibility is real |
| 10 | Q-Ablation | ✅ PASS | Q is necessary |

## Conclusion

All destruction attempts failed.
The theory is structurally closed.
