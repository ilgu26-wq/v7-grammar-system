# 02. COLLAPSE QUALITY (Q)

## The Superior State Variable

---

## Definition

**Collapse Quality (Q)** is the state that determines whether a collapse can become profit.

It is not derived from micro conditions.
It is a **superior state** — emergent but not determined.

## Q Classification

| Q | Name | Characteristics | Mean PnL |
|---|------|-----------------|----------|
| Q1 | Instant Death | MAE large, τ≤1 | -1.99 |
| Q2 | Turbulence | τ=2-4, high volatility | -0.53 |
| Q3 | Structural | τ≥4, DC converged | +0.46 |
| Q4 | Convergent | τ≥6, low entropy | +1.55 |

---

## Core Discovery (EXP-5)

Same micro conditions can produce different Q states.
Different Q states produce different outcomes.

**Therefore: Q is not a function of Micro.**

| Test | Result |
|------|--------|
| Shuffle p-value | 0.0014 |
| Within-bucket separation | Preserved |
| Judgment | INSTITUTIONAL-GRADE |

## The Two-Layer Structure

```
┌─────────────────────────────────────────┐
│  LAYER 2: Q (Collapse Quality)          │
│  "Can this become profit?"              │
├─────────────────────────────────────────┤
│  LAYER 1: Micro (Coordinates)           │
│  "Is entry admissible?"                 │
└─────────────────────────────────────────┘
```

**Micro determines admissibility.**
**Q determines profitability.**

## Q-Ablation Result (EXP-10)

| Condition | Separation |
|-----------|------------|
| With Q | 3.55 |
| Without Q (Micro only) | 0.24 |
| **Ratio** | **7%** |

Micro alone achieves only 7% of Q's separation.

**Without Q, alpha disappears.**

## Conclusion

Q is not optional.
Q is the structure.

If you cannot distinguish Q2 from Q3:
- You will take trades that look good but are Q2
- You will skip trades that look bad but are Q3/Q4
- You will optimize on noise
- You will blame the market

Q recognition failure is the root cause of all alpha failure.
