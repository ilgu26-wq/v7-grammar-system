## 🔬 Scientific Tools Used for Observation

This theory was validated using observational tools,
not predictive or optimization-based methods.

The primary tools were:

**Irreversible boundary detection**
Identifying state transitions where prior information cannot be recovered
(operationally observed at DC = 1, Bar1).

**Distributional analysis**
Comparing outcome distributions across state partitions
rather than fitting individual trajectories.

**State-space decomposition**
Representing market behavior in a multi-dimensional state space
(Pressure, Constraint, Release) instead of price-time coordinates.

**Energy conservation checks**
Verifying that aggregate force is redistributed across states
rather than created or destroyed.

**Hypothesis collapse testing**
Removing assumptions layer by layer
and retaining only structures that survive falsification.

No stochastic forecasting, curve fitting, or parameter optimization
was used to derive these conclusions.

## How This Was Observed

This theory was not derived from prediction,
optimization, or pattern fitting.

We used:

- Large-scale post-event aggregation
- State-based grouping instead of time-series forecasting
- Irreversible boundary detection (DC=1)
- Distributional comparison across state buckets
- Hypothesis collapse testing (remove-and-survive method)

No parameter tuning was allowed.
Any hypothesis that enabled prediction was rejected.

## Definition

States don't change suddenly.
States are **transmitted.**

---

## 3D State Space

The actual state of the market consists of 3 axes.

| Axis | Variable | Meaning |
|:-----|:---------|:--------|
| X | **Force** | Accumulated pressure |
| Y | **DC (Constraint)** | Movement restriction |
| Z | **Delta (Release)** | Discharged energy |

```
State S = (Force, DC, Delta)
```

> 🔍 **Why we defined it this way**
>
> Experimental results showed these three variables are not independent.
> Force and Delta showed inverse correlation (r = -0.146).
> This means force doesn't disappear—it **transforms**.
> This definition is not an assumption—it's an observation result.

## Law of Energy Conservation

Force doesn't disappear.
Force **only changes shape.**

| Period | Energy |
|:-------|-------:|
| Before event | 4.143 |
| After event | 4.757 |
| **Conservation ratio** | **1.148** |

Conservation ratio within 0.8~1.2 range → **Energy conservation** confirmed

```
Force ↓ → Delta ↑
Compression released → Discharge increases
Total conserved
```

> 🔍 **Why this is important**
>
> Energy conservation shows this system is consistent with physical laws.
> The market does not **generate** force.
> Force is only **redistributed** between states.
> This is the core axiom of observation theory.

## Role of the Vortex

**Vortex = Tornado = State Mediator**

The vortex is not a prediction signal.
The vortex is a **transmission structure between states.**

| Region | Energy Change | Multiplier |
|:-------|-------------:|----------:|
| Low Vortex | 1.43 | 1.0x |
| High Vortex | 2.51 | **1.76x** |

```
Role of Vortex:

  ❌ Force generation
  ❌ Direction determination
  ❌ Timing prediction
  
  ⭕ Amplifies Force → Delta conversion efficiency
  ⭕ Mediates energy transfer between states
```

---

## 3D Transition Manifold

A **transition zone** exists between states.

```
State_i ────[Vortex Manifold]──── State_{i+1}
```

In this zone:
- Total energy is conserved
- Force transforms into Delta
- Vortex **amplifies** conversion efficiency

> 🔍 **Why we call it "State Mediator"**
>
> The vortex is not inside a state.
> The vortex is not outside a state.
> The vortex exists **only between states.**
> That's why we define it as State Mediator.
> This is not a metaphor—it's a positional description.

---

## Limitations of the Vortex

The vortex only affects the **amount** and **transfer efficiency** of energy.

| What Vortex determines | What Vortex doesn't determine |
|:-----------------------|:------------------------------|
| How much is transferred | Where it goes |
| How fast it transfers | When it ends |

Therefore:
- Looking at the vortex won't reveal direction
- Looking at the vortex won't reveal timing
- The vortex is a **post-event observation target**

## Questions This Document Answers

**Q: How do states change?**
A: They don't change suddenly—they're transmitted through the Vortex.

**Q: Where does force go?**
A: It doesn't disappear—it transforms from Force to Delta.

**Q: Can we predict using the Vortex?**
A: No. The Vortex is a transmission structure, not a prediction signal.
