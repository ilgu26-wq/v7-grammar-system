## 1. Signal Role Finalization

### Declaration
**Signals do NOT make decisions.**

All decisions originate from V7 Grammar. Signals serve strictly as:
- Execution triggers
- Environment ignition conditions
- Context modifiers

### Signal Classification (Lift-Based Validation)

| Role | Signal | Lift | Win Rate | Status |
|------|--------|------|----------|--------|
| **ENTRY** | STB_SHORT | 4.62 | 94.1% | Active |
| **ENTRY** | STB_LONG | 4.62 | 94.1% | Active |
| **ENTRY** | SCALP_A | 3.36 | 68.4% | Active |
| **ENTRY** | HUNT_1 | 3.22 | 65.6% | Active |
| **IGNITION** | RESIST_zscore_0.5 | 4.51 | 91.8% | Active |
| **IGNITION** | RESIST_zscore_1.0 | 4.67 | 95.0% | Active |
| **IGNITION** | RESIST_zscore_1.5 | 4.72 | 96.1% | Active |
| **IGNITION** | Channel_extreme_high | 3.79 | 77.1% | Active |
| **IGNITION** | Channel_extreme_low | 2.94 | 59.9% | Active |
| **MODIFIER** | Ratio_extreme_high | 2.51 | 51.2% | Context only |
| **MODIFIER** | Ratio_extreme_low | 2.47 | 50.3% | Context only |
| **DELETED** | POC_touch | 2.69 | 54.7% | Removed (lift < 3.0) |
| **DELETED** | ZPOC_touch | 2.58 | 52.5% | Removed (lift < 3.0) |
| **DELETED** | Blackline_touch | 2.67 | 54.4% | Removed (lift < 3.0) |
| **DELETED** | SPS_ratio_series | N/A | 25% | Removed (random) |

### Legacy Signal Handling
Old signals were retained in codebase but stripped of decision power. They may trigger logging but do not influence V7 Grammar output.

## 2. OPA–V7 Separation (Verified in Realtime)

### V7 Grammar Behavior
- V7 Grammar produces a decision on **every candle**
- Output types: `ENTRY`, `EXIT`, `OBSERVE`
- `OBSERVE` is a decision (condition not met), not absence of decision

### OPA Behavior
- OPA controls execution authority only
- Output types: `ALLOW`, `DENY`, `HALT`
- OPA does NOT modify:
  - `direction`
  - `delta_scope`
  - `theta`
  - Any V7 decision field

### Verified Log Separation
```
[V7_DECISION] action=ENTRY, direction=SHORT, theta=0, reason=EXECUTION
[PAPER] OPA_ENTRY | layer=OPA | scope=t-ε | delta=3.42

[V7_DECISION] action=OBSERVE, direction=SHORT, theta=0, reason=CONDITION_NOT_MET
(No PAPER log = execution blocked)
```

### Critical Clarifications
- `OBSERVE` ≠ no decision
- SL occurrence ≠ logic failure
- SL in `theta=0, scope=t-ε` is structurally expected (STB boundary exposure)

## 3. IGNITION Research Closure

### Equivalence Tests Performed (2026-01-23)

#### EXP-1: Combination Test
- **Question:** Does Channel + Zscore combination improve lift?
- **Result:** Δlift = -0.099 (no additive effect)
- **Verdict:** `GRAMMAR_INDEPENDENT`

#### EXP-2: Accumulation Test
- **Question:** Does N>1 ignition count improve performance?
- **Result:** Non-monotonic (N=3 shows lower lift than N=2)
- **Verdict:** `NON_MONOTONIC` (scoring not justified)

#### EXP-3: Regime Sensitivity Test
- **Question:** Does IGNITION lift vary by market regime?
- **Result:** RANGE regime shows reduced lift (2.129 vs 3.225 in TREND)
- **Verdict:** `HIGH_VARIANCE` (observation only, no logic change)

### Research Closure Declaration
> **No further grammar changes are justified based on these tests.**
>
> IGNITION operates as condition, not score.
> Combination effects, accumulation effects, and regime sensitivity
> do not provide sufficient evidence to modify grammar structure.

## 4. Known Limitations (Explicit and Bounded)

### STB Structural Characteristics
- STB operates in `t-ε` (pre-confirmation phase)
- Boundary exposure is inherent, not a bug
- 50–53% contextual win-rate is structural baseline

### Theta Clarification
- `θ=0`: Candidate phase, SL possible
- `θ≥3`: Confirmation label (post-hoc, not execution logic)
- "SL should not occur" applies only to `θ≥3` states

### Paper Mode Purpose
- Paper Mode exists to absorb `t-ε` phase exposure
- Consecutive SL in Paper Mode is expected during sideways markets
- Paper → Live transition requires regime filter, not logic change

## 5. Final Status Declaration

### Verification Results
- [x] No logical contradictions found
- [x] No data inconsistencies found
- [x] V7 Grammar produces decision on every candle
- [x] OPA separation verified in realtime
- [x] Signal classification completed with lift-based validation
- [x] IGNITION equivalence tests show no grammar change needed

### System Status
> **The system is verified safe for Paper → Live transition.**
>
> This statement is based on structural validation, not performance promises.
> No win-rate guarantees are made or implied.
