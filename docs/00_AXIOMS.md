# 00. AXIOMS

## The Foundation of Collapse Physics

---

## Irreversibility Axiom

> **Before Bar1, information that determines outcome does not exist.**

This is not a hypothesis. It is a premise.

The system does not predict what will happen.
It observes what has already been structurally permitted.

---

## Why This Is an Axiom, Not a Claim

Traditional systems assume:
- Past data contains future information
- Better analysis extracts more signal
- Prediction accuracy can be optimized

This system assumes none of that.

Instead:
- Information is **created** at the moment of collapse
- Before collapse, only **coordinates** exist
- After collapse, **states** become observable

## Experimental Confirmation: EXP-9 Time Reversal

To verify the axiom is load-bearing, we reversed time.

| Direction | Q4-Q1 Separation |
|-----------|------------------|
| Forward | +3.48 |
| Reversed | -0.73 |

**Ratio: -0.21** (Structure collapsed)

When time is reversed:
- Q classification becomes meaningless
- Outcome separation vanishes
- Profit filter disappears

**Conclusion:**
The Q structure depends on temporal direction.
Irreversibility is not optional — it is constitutive.

## Implication

This axiom means:

| What We Can Do | What We Cannot Do |
|----------------|-------------------|
| Observe permitted states | Predict outcomes |
| Filter inadmissible entries | Optimize for profit |
| Recognize collapse quality | Create alpha from nothing |

---

## Final Statement

This axiom is the first wall of the theory.
Everything else — Microplanet, Q, Isomorphism — rests on this.

If this axiom fails, the theory fails.
It has not failed.
