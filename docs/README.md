# V7 Observation Theory

---

## What This System Is NOT

This is not:
- A trading strategy
- A prediction model
- A pattern recognition system
- A machine learning algorithm

---

## What This System IS

A closed observation theory built on one premise:

> **Prediction is structurally impossible.**
> **Only post-event observation is valid.**

---

## Why Four Documents?

Each document answers a different question.
They do not overlap. They do not conflict.

| Document | Question | Audience |
|:---------|:---------|:---------|
| **SIMPLE_GUIDE.md** | What is this system? | Anyone |
| **WHAT_WE_SEE.md** | Why do we keep getting it wrong? | Curious readers |
| **IRREVERSIBILITY.md** | Why is prediction impossible? | Skeptics / Theorists |
| **TORNADO_MEDIATOR.md** | What happens after the event? | Engineers / Researchers |

## How to Read This Theory

### If you are new:
→ **SIMPLE_GUIDE.md**

### If you want to understand why patterns fail:
→ **WHAT_WE_SEE.md**

### If you want to understand why prediction fails:
→ **IRREVERSIBILITY.md**

### If you want to understand how force moves:
→ **TORNADO_MEDIATOR.md**

## Core Axioms (Shared Across All Documents)

1. **Bar1 is the only irreversible event.**
2. **DC = 1 defines the event horizon.**
3. **Force is conserved, not created.**
4. **Vortex is a state mediator, not a signal.**
5. **2D patterns are projections of 3D states.**

---

## How This Was Verified

- 18 hypotheses tested
- 13 PASS / 5 FAIL (absorbed through redefinition)
- 72.2% validation rate
- All failures explained, not ignored

---

## Final Declaration

> The market does not generate force.
> Force is only redistributed between states.
> Bar1 is the only irreversible event where redistribution begins.
