# V7 Grammar System — Archive Snapshot (2026-01-28)

This document marks the **formal closure** of the V7 Grammar System research.

## Status
- Decision grammar: **frozen**
- Validation protocol: **closed**
- Hypotheses H1–H5: **resolved** (PASS: 4, SKIP: 1, FAIL: 0)
- No further optimization or rule modification is permitted

## Scope of Closure
This archive certifies that:
- All falsifiable hypotheses were tested
- Adversarial and inverse conditions were explicitly evaluated
- No unresolved contradiction remains

The system is not optimized further.
Any future work must be conducted under a **separate methodology**.
