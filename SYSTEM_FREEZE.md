# V7 FORCE SYSTEM — FROZEN

**Status: COMPLETE**

## Final Declaration

```
"본 시스템은 에너지를 측정하지 않는다.
 에너지가 의미를 갖지 못하는 모든 관측을
 데이터 기반으로 제거한 결과만을 사용한다.

 판단은 추가 정보로 개선되지 않았고,
 오직 제거를 통해 안정화되었다."
```

---

## Axiom (LOCKED)

```
A0 (Irreversibility):
"Before Bar1, information that determines the outcome does not exist."
This is not a limitation. This is the starting point.
```

---

## Final System Structure

```
[All Observation Data]
        ↓
(Remove based on irreversibility)
        ↓
[Frame Preservation Check] ← Integrated into classifier
        ↓
Storm-IN / Storm-OUT
        ↓
ALLOW or REFUSE
```

**Adding more → Weakens judgment**  
**Removing more → Loses meaning**  

This is the **minimum complete set**.

## Experimental Evidence Chain

| Phase | Result | Meaning |
|-------|--------|---------|
| M (3/3) | PASS | Axiom feasibility |
| M' (2/2) | PASS | Anti-hallucination |
| O (4/4) | PASS | Adversarial resistance |
| H (6/8) | PASS | Hypothesis validation |
| I (5/6) | PASS | Irreversibility lock |
| J (3/5) | PASS | Generative structures |
| J6 | PASS (33.5pp) | Energy asymmetry via state |
| J7 | FAIL (0.7pp) | Separate frame gate = redundant |

---

## EXP-J7 Key Finding

```
Storm-IN + frame_alive=TRUE:  loss=24.1%
Storm-IN + frame_alive=FALSE: loss=24.9%
Difference: 0.7pp → NOT SIGNIFICANT
```

**Interpretation:**  
Frame observation is ALREADY integrated into Storm classifier.  
Separate frame gate layer is REDUNDANT.

This means:
- ✅ Storm-IN/OUT classification already contains frame state
- ❌ Additional frame gate provides no value
- ✅ System is already minimal

---

## Removed (Data-Verified Useless)

| Item | Phase | Verdict |
|------|-------|---------|
| Continuous Force values | N-0 | Useless |
| Force spike magnitude | O | Useless |
| Up/Down energy asymmetry | J6 | State-only |
| Coordinate distance/angles | N-0 | Useless |
| Combination scores | O | Weakens |
| Separate frame gate | J7 | Redundant |

---

## Retained (Survived All Phases)

| Item | Status |
|------|--------|
| Storm-IN / Storm-OUT | ✅ CORE |
| Frame preservation (in classifier) | ✅ INTEGRATED |
| Irreversible boundary (Bar1) | ✅ AXIOM |
| Refusal priority | ✅ PRINCIPLE |

---

## Multi-Dimensional Force Meter Definition (FINAL)

```
The Multi-Dimensional Force Meter:
- Does NOT measure "how strong"
- ONLY observes "is speech permitted now"

Output: Boolean (TRUE/FALSE)
- No scores
- No weights  
- No continuous values

But per EXP-J7: This is ALREADY in the Storm classifier.
No separate layer needed.
```

---

## Validation Protocol v1.0

```
Gate Conditions:
- V-2 (Adversarial) 4/4 PASS
- V-1 (Control) maintained
- False-ALLOW < 30%

Current: ALL PASS → RELEASE GATE OPEN
```

---

## Freeze Conditions

This system is frozen when:

1. ✅ All falsifiable alternatives rejected (Phase I)
2. ✅ Adversarial tests pass (Phase O)
3. ✅ Structure matches data (Phase J6)
4. ✅ No redundant layers (Phase J7)
5. ✅ Validation protocol passes

**SYSTEM FROZEN**

---

## Allowed After Freeze

- ✅ Confirm state
- ✅ Classify transitions
- ✅ Enforce refusal or allowance

## Forbidden After Freeze

- ❌ Explain causes
- ❌ Reconstruct the past
- ❌ Predict the future
- ❌ Add new observations
- ❌ Modify classifier weights

---

## One-Line Summary

```
We removed what data proved useless.
What remains is what survived.
```
