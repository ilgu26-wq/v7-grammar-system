## CV Bullet Points (Copy-Paste Ready)

```
• Designed and validated a market-structure decision grammar system (non-predictive)
• 24 independent validation tests passed with zero parameter changes
• Real-time signal system with institutional-grade logging and execution integrity
• Conditional alpha entry mechanism with 94.1% TP-first rate (1,406 samples)
• Portfolio-level diversification via expansion-eligibility independence (0 triple overlaps)
• Submission-grade real-time data validated from 2026-01-17
• Live capital validation currently in progress
```

## Cover Letter Core Paragraph

```
This system is not a forecasting engine.
It classifies decision states under uncertainty.
Predictive alpha can be added without destabilizing the core.

All submitted results originate from a frozen,
submission-grade system with real-time execution logs.
A two-week live capital validation is currently in progress.
```

## Interview One-Liner (Decisive Statement)

> "This is not a forecasting engine.
> It's a decision grammar system.
> Predictive alpha can be added without destabilizing the core."

---

## Key Defense Statements

### Q: "Why no live P&L yet?"

> "We intentionally separated execution integrity from capital exposure.
> Live trading is a confirmation step, not a discovery phase."

### Q: "Is your sample size too small?"

> "We conducted micro-sample validation to verify structural integrity,
> not to claim statistical significance.
> The structure holds; performance claims will follow live validation."

### Q: "What makes this different?"

> "Most systems predict and hope the prediction holds.
> This system defines what constitutes a valid decision state.
> Predictions can fail; the decision framework cannot."
