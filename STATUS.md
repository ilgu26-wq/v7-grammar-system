# Research Status (Frozen: 2026-02-01)

## Current State

All available experimental and textual data has been archived in `/DUMP`.

The **Depth-based world partition** is considered **structurally closed** with respect to the included data.

**No causal explanation for depth formation is claimed at this stage.**

---

## What Has Been Validated

### 1. World Partition (Empirically Closed)

| Partition | Coverage | E_RESP Lead% | Status |
|-----------|----------|--------------|--------|
| **SLOW Terminal** | 88.9% | 96.8% | Near-deterministic |
| **FAST Terminal** | 11.1% | 63.2% baseline | Conditional judgment possible |

### 2. FAST Terminal Islands (OOS Validated)

| Island State | Avg Lead% | Folds | Status |
|--------------|-----------|-------|--------|
| High_Comp_Large_Weak_Low_Low_Mid | 85.4% | 4/5 | Stable |
| High_Loose_Large_Weak_Low_Low_Mid | 74.3% | 5/5 | Stable |
| Low_Loose_Small_Weak_Low_Low_Mid | 66.7% | 5/5 | Stable |

### 3. SLOW Terminal Key Factors (97%+ Lead)

| Factor | Bin | N | Lead% |
|--------|-----|---|-------|
| delta | Small | 693 | 97.4% |
| depth | Low | 1,320 | 97.3% |
| ER | Low | 1,713 | 97.1% |
| channel | Top | 555 | 97.1% |

## What Is NOT Explained

1. **How Depth is generated** (causal mechanism unknown)
2. **Why Depth accumulates in certain regimes and dissipates in others**
3. **The transition dynamics between Fast and Slow terminal states**

---

## Direction Change

The research focus has **explicitly shifted**.

### Previous Phase (Structural)
> "What does Depth explain?"

### Next Phase (Causal)
> "Under what conditions does Depth form instead of dissipate?"

This is treated as a **dynamical problem**, not a classification problem.

## Data Integrity Statement

- All experiments included, including failures
- No selection of favorable results
- Raw notes preserved without editing
- Contradictions and abandoned ideas included

This repository serves as a **frozen record** of the pre-causal research phase.
